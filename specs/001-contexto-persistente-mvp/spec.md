# Feature Specification: Contexto Persistente (MVP)

**Feature Branch**: `001-contexto-persistente-mvp`  
**Created**: 2024-12-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Contexto Persistente (MVP) - El bot debe mantener un historial de conversaci√≥n para usuarios individuales y grupos, permitiendo responder con contexto apropiado"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí "Bot must maintain conversation history for individual users and groups"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: individual users, groups, bot
   ‚Üí Actions: maintain history, respond with context
   ‚Üí Data: conversation history, messages, participants
   ‚Üí Constraints: appropriate context (MVP scope)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED] Context scope defined as conversation memory
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED] Storage approach abstracted from specification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User can have contextual conversations in DMs
   ‚Üí Groups can reference previous conversations
   ‚Üí Bot maintains separate context per user/group
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Context persistence across sessions
   ‚Üí Appropriate context retrieval for responses
   ‚Üí Separation of user vs group contexts
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Conversation Context, Message History, Participants
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No implementation details included
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Focus on user value and business needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-22
- Q: Cuando un usuario hace una referencia ambigua como "¬øQu√© pas√≥ con eso?" sin contexto claro, ¬øc√≥mo debe responder el bot? ‚Üí A: Pedir aclaraci√≥n ("¬øPodr√≠as ser m√°s espec√≠fico sobre qu√© tema te refieres?")
- Q: ¬øC√≥mo manejar√° el bot conversaciones largas donde el usuario cambia repetidamente de tema? ‚Üí A: Mantener contexto de todos los temas pero destacar el m√°s reciente
- Q: ¬øCu√°nto tiempo debe mantenerse el historial de conversaci√≥n antes de que sea eliminado o archivado? ‚Üí A: 30 d√≠as desde la √∫ltima interacci√≥n con advertencia al usuario
- Q: ¬øC√≥mo debe manejar el bot el contexto cuando un usuario participa en m√∫ltiples grupos diferentes? ‚Üí A: Mantener contextos completamente separados por grupo
- Q: ¬øQu√© nivel de detalle debe incluir el contexto almacenado para generar respuestas relevantes? ‚Üí A: Solo mensajes de texto completos y timestamps

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Slack user, I want to have natural, contextual conversations with the AGI Force bot where it remembers our previous interactions, so that I don't have to repeat information and can build upon previous discussions. Whether I'm chatting in a direct message or participating in a group channel, the bot should understand the ongoing conversation context and respond appropriately.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has had previous conversations with the bot in DM, **When** the user sends a follow-up message referencing earlier topics, **Then** the bot responds with relevant context from the conversation history
2. **Given** a group channel has ongoing discussions with the bot, **When** any member references previous topics or decisions made in that channel, **Then** the bot provides contextually appropriate responses based on the group's conversation history
3. **Given** a user interacts with the bot in both DM and group contexts, **When** the user switches between contexts, **Then** the bot maintains separate, appropriate context for each interaction space
4. **Given** a new user starts their first conversation with the bot, **When** they send an initial message, **Then** the bot responds appropriately without assuming any prior context
5. **Given** a long conversation history exists, **When** a user asks a question, **Then** the bot retrieves and uses the most relevant context rather than all historical data

### Edge Cases
- What happens when conversation history becomes very large (performance considerations)?
- How does the system handle users who delete/edit messages after bot responses?
- What happens when a user is removed from a group - does their context persist?
- How does the bot handle references to conversations that occurred before the context feature was enabled?
- What happens when multiple users in a group reference different aspects of previous conversations simultaneously?
- How does the bot prioritize between recent context and explicit user references to older topics?
- What happens when a user tries to reference context from a group they were removed from?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain separate conversation history for each unique user in direct messages
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain separate conversation history for each unique group/channel
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist conversation context across bot restarts and user sessions
- **FR-004**: System MUST retrieve relevant conversation context when generating responses
- **FR-005**: System MUST distinguish between user context (DMs) and group context (channels) for the same user
- **FR-006**: System MUST store message content, timestamps, and participant information for context reconstruction
- **FR-007**: System MUST limit context retrieval to avoid performance degradation (reasonable scope for MVP)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle new users/groups without assuming prior context exists
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain conversation continuity even when users reference topics from previous sessions
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure that group context is only accessible within that specific group
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure that user DM context is only accessible in conversations with that specific user
- **FR-012**: System MUST request clarification when users make ambiguous references that cannot be resolved from available context
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain context of all conversation topics while prioritizing the most recent topic for response relevance
- **FR-014**: System MUST retain conversation history for 30 days from the last interaction
- **FR-015**: System MUST notify users before conversation history is deleted due to retention policy
- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain completely separate contexts for each group, preventing cross-group context bleeding
- **FR-017**: System MUST store only message text content and timestamps for context reconstruction (MVP scope)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Conversation Context**: Represents the ongoing dialogue state for a specific user or group, including message history, key topics, and temporal sequence
- **Message History**: Individual messages with content, sender, timestamp, and conversation thread information
- **Participant Context**: Information about users and their roles within specific conversation contexts (individual vs group member)
- **Context Scope**: Boundary definition that separates user DM contexts from group contexts, ensuring appropriate privacy and relevance
